# Submarines - Computer Science Graduation Project

## Description
This project is a part of the expanded computer science highschool major, and follows a template of creating a Windows Forms App on Visual Studio,
As an upgraded system for an organization using skills like communication with a Microsoft Access database using SQL and development in C#.
My project is about creating an improved version of the known board game "Battleship" for a made-up organization that plays it.  

## Installation
Download and Extract the Project_YishayAizenman.zip folder to the path C:\Projects_2025. (a requirement by the project guidelines, you may need to create that folder)
This folder contains several folders used for the project, one of which is the Program folder which has the full Visual Studio solution eg. code files, Resources, etc.

Also provided is a Program.zip folder which contains the Submarines.exe application file, along with several necessary files. 
If you want to just run the application, you can swap this Program folder with the Program folder inside the Project_YishayAizenman.zip folder.

When running the application, a login page shows up. you can log in using these admin user login credentials - ID: 18, Password: 1.
